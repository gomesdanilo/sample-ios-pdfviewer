# sample-ios-pdfviewer

Sample iOS project used to render a PDF file using the SDK libraries. At the moment this project is using the legacy SDK. On iOS 11 there is a new SDK. This was a good oportunity to show a more "low level" framework use, in Objective C.
This is just a portfolio project, but you can use it as a reference.

Keypoints:
- Built with XCode 8.3.3
- Objective C
- Swift 3
- Navigation controller - push example
- Interfaces built using code directly (no interface builder)
- Reading of resources stored in the app bundle
- Project with mixed Swift and Objective C at the same time (Bridging-Header)

This project is on Github, so this implies use of git and github.
